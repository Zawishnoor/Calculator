**Calculator
Overview**
Styled Calculator is a web-based calculator application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with an intuitive and responsive interface to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Features**
This calculator includes a clean layout with a 4x4 grid of buttons, real-time input display, a backspace button for editing, and error handling for invalid expressions such as division by zero. The interface is styled for clarity and ease of use, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

**How It Works**
Users can click on the calculator buttons to build mathematical expressions, which are shown in the display field. The "=" button calculates the result using JavaScript’s built-in evaluation logic. The "C" button clears the entire input, while the backspace (<-) button removes the last character entered.

**Files Included**
index.html – The main calculator interface

style.css – Styling rules for layout and UI

script.js – JavaScript logic for functionality

README – Documentation and usage guide

Future Enhancements
Potential improvements include keyboard support, dark mode, memory functions, and scientific operations for advanced users.
